Overview
This is a simple implementation of the Pig game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Pig game is a fun dice game where players take turns rolling a die and accumulating points, with the objective of being the first to reach a target score.

How to Play
Objective: The goal of the Pig game is to be the first player to reach a certain score (usually 100 points).

Equipment: You need one standard six-sided die and a web browser to play this version of the game.

Gameplay:

Players take turns rolling a single die.
On a player's turn, they can roll the die as many times as they want by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
If they roll a 1, they lose all points for that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
If they choose to end their turn voluntarily (before rolling a 1), they can click the "Hold" button to add the turn total to their overall score.
The first player to reach or exceed the target score (usually 100 points) wins the game.
Features:

Player 1 and Player 2 are displayed with their current scores.
The current player's turn is highlighted.
"Roll Dice" button to roll the die.
"Hold" button to end the turn and add the turn total to the overall score.
Dice images change dynamically based on the rolled number.
